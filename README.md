# Creating a Starter Project Template
In this chapter, I learned how to create a well-structured Flutter project by organizing files and folders for better maintainability. I discovered how to create folders within the project, grouping them by file types such as assets, models, and widgets to keep the codebase clean and manageable. I also learned how to separate and structure widgets into different files, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. By organizing widgets into their own files, I can focus on specific parts of the app, improve code reusability, and streamline collaboration in larger projects. This approach to project structure is essential for scaling Flutter applications and maintaining a clear and efficient workflow.
